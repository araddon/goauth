Update status uses a POST method.

Revision History 
----------------

    == Version 0.0.3 ==

   Previous versions only worked with twitter.  Issues, especially
   with Googles API, have been fixed.
   
   Replaced URL Encoder with Calvin McAnarney version that conforms
   to RFC 3986.
   (https://github.com/csmcanarney/gooauth/blob/master/encode.go)
 
   Additional issues with Googles OAuth API fixed. - Inparticular 
   Certain chars contiained in their tokens end up getting double 
   encoded if you follow the RFC specification.  Current fix is a
   bit of a hack, parts are allowed to be Encoded twice, and then
   replaced with the actual values that should be sent.

   Tested with Googles Buzz, Adwords, Calender & Reader OAuth 
   servies all functions as expected. 

   Additional testing is required with other services, such as
   twitter, digg to see if these fixes have effected these.

	oauth.Get now recives a Params object too. 

   == Version  0.0.2 ==
   
   Minor fixes to Makefile to work with latest revision of Go. 
   Additional fixes to other changes in Go.


   == Version 0.0.1 ==

   Initial release, general mechs are functional GET/POST, creation
   of an OAuth consumer.
